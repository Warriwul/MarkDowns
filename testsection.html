  Language, as the primary medium of thinking, travels between the individual mind, the larger social order, and the physical world, seeming to bypass the body. 
  If we look a little deeper, however, a more embodied and materially influenced structure of language emerges. 
  This is made clearer by examining how our physical surroundings and physiognomy have been involved in the origins of speech and of the process of thinking and in the development of writing.
